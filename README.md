        1. creating the food log
        2. creating the exercise log
        3. creating the profile page
        4. setting up the tech stack
      For the food and exercise log pages I'll start by creating a searchbar to search for the needed information. I'll need to understand what information the api is giving as well as how to use it. Once I have control over the data I can then focus on styling the pages. Next or the same pages I'll need to create logs that can display the daily content. For each new day the logs should be cleared and all previous days should be stored in a database. Next will be creating a profile page that can house all the users personal information. And lastly, determine and setup our remaining technologies: our database and server.
