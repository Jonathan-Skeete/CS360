    1. Creating landing page
    2. Recipe Page
    3. Tips and articles Page
    4. Creating logo

     When creating the landing page I'll start by creating the Navbar to host all the linked pages and the logo i'll put on the left side of the navbar. I'll then
    link all the pages to eachother. Also on the landing page I want to implement a carousel that hosts about 3-4 links to articles. The carousel would showcase        images that when you click them they'll take you to the link of the article. I want to implement an about section but I am still between including it onto the      landing page or create an about page itself. At the bottom of each page I will include a footer.For the recipe page, I will host different recipes in cards,        when you click the card, it will craete a pop up that shows the recipe instructions and nutritional facts. For the tips and articles page, I will implement         articles of tips, foods, clothing, exercies ETC into columns. These links will be an image, with the URL and the date and time they were created with the           author as well. Finally for the logo I want to create a sleeker more professional logo that compelements the pages.

    1. creating the food log
    2. creating the exercise log
    3. creating the profile page
    4. setting up the tech stack
    
    For the food and exercise log pages, I'll start by creating a search bar to search for the needed information. I'll need to understand what information the API is giving as well as how to use it. Once I have control over the data, I can then focus on styling the pages. Next, on the same pages, I'll need to create logs that can display the daily content. For each new day, the logs should be cleared, and all previous days should be stored in a database. Next will be creating a profile page that can house all the user's personal information. And lastly, determine and set up our remaining technologies: our database and server.
